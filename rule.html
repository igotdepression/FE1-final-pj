        <h3>Rules of Tic Tac Toe</h3>
        <div class="rules">
            <p1>
                When playing Tic-Tac-Toe, there are several simple and easy-to-follow rules that you should observe. The rules that you need to be aware of include the following:
            </p1>
            <ul>
                <li>The traditional version of Tic-Tac-Toe must be played on a 3x3 grid that incorporates 9 squares.</li>
                <li>Players must select their mark before the game starts (either X or O) and must play the entire game using the same mark.</li>
                <li>Players must take turns, making only 1 mark with each turn.</li>
                <li>Marks can only be placed in empty squares, and once it is placed, it is permanent.</li>
                <li>The winner is the first player to get 3 of their marks in a straight line (the line can be positioned diagonally, vertically, or horizontally).</li>
                <li>The game is over when all 9 squares are filled with marks, even if none of the players have a straight line of 3 marks.</li>
                <li>If neither player has a straight line of 3 marks, it is considered a tie.</li>
            </ul>
