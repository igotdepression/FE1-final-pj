                Before we jump right into exploring the purpose, rules and gameplay, let’s take a look at where the game comes from. 
                Many don’t know this, but Tic-Tac-Toe is a game derived from Terni Lapilli, which is a game that was played in the 1st Century BC 
                in the Roman Empire. Evidence of this is seen in the drawings of this game over Rome. Back then, players used 3 pebbles to play with.
                The pebbles would need to be moved around at each turn, which means that Terni Lapilli was a slightly more complicated game than today’s Tic-Tac-Toe. 
                Now, with a bit of background on the origins of the game, let’s dive into the nitty-gritty of how it is played.
